# Gost-DOM - A headless browser for Go

**The Go-to headless browser for TDD workflows.**

Gost-DOM is a headless browser written in Go intended to write tests of web
application in Go that relies on JavaScript. Properties of Gost-DOM-based tests:

- Tests run in parallel due to complete _complete isolation_[^1]
- No erratic behaviour due to 100% predictable UI reactions.
- "Blazingly fast". No out-of-process calls, not even thread boundaries. Web
  application code runs in the test thread, so a panic in your code keeps a full
  stack trace to the test case. [^2]
- Dependencies can be replaced while testing.

Yet Gost-DOM still uses HTTP request and responses for verification, testing the
entire stack, as well as middlewares. 

[Read this to get started](./docs/Getting-started.md), and see a quick example
of usage.

## Looking for sponsors

This tool has reached a level where it can be used to test some web applications
with JavaScript, e.g., simple HTMX applications. But there is still a lot to
build to support just the most relevant Web APIs.

I've made good progress because of too much spare time; but that will not last.
If I could find enough sponsors, it could mean the difference between continued
development, or death ðŸ˜¢

For companies wanting to sponsor, I can send formal invoices too. More

- Want to contribute to the project, there's a very rough early [guide describing the overall project structure](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Versioning and breaking changes

While still versioned as 0.x, this library will _generally_ follow the
convention, that a minor version increment indicates a breaking change.

Breaking changes will be announced up-front in the [anouncements
discussions](https://github.com/orgs/gost-dom/discussions/categories/announcements).

When feasible withing a reasonable amount of work, an alternate solution will be
made available as part of a deprecation before the the breaking change is
released.

## Adding support for library X

The goal is to support all modern JS frameworks, but I can't make tests for all.
If you can contribute a "test project" with specific JS frameworks that will be
a great help to detect compatibility issues, and potential extension to the test
suites.

See the guidelines in the [contributor documentation](./CONTRIBUTING.md#Providing-test-projects)

## Project background

Go and HTMX is gaining in popularity as a stack.

While Go has great tooling for verifying request/responses of HTTP applications,
but for HTMX, or just client-side scripting with server side rendering, you need
browser automation to test the behaviour.

This introduces a significant overhead; not only from out-of-process
communication with the browser, but also the necessity of launching your server.

This overhead discourages a TDD loop.

The purpose of this project is to enable a fast TDD feedback loop these types of
project, where verification depend on

- Behaviour of client-side scripts.
- Browser behaviour when interacting with browser elements, e.g., clicking the
  submit button submits a form, and redirects are followed.

### Unique features

Being written in Go, this library supports consuming an
[`http.Handler`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Handler) directly. This removes the
necessity managing TCP ports, and start a server on a real port. Your HTTP
server is consumed by test code, like any other Go component would, also
allowing you to replace dependencies for the test if applicable.

This also makes it easy to run parallel tests in isolation as each can create
their own _instance_ of the HTTP handler.

### Drawbacks to Browser automation

- You cannot verify how it look; e.g. you cannot get a screenshot of a failing
test, nor use such screenshots for snapshot tests.
- The verification doesn't prove that it works as intended in _all browsers_ you
want to support.

This isn't intended as a replacement for the cases where an end-2-end test is
the right choice. It is intended as a tool to help when you want a smaller
isolated test, e.g. mocking out part of the behaviour;

## Project status

This still early pre-release, and only the core web APIs are supported, and not
100%. Check the [Feature list](./docs/Features.md) for a list.

The 0.1 focus was to support a common session based login-flow using HTMX,
meaning to support content swapping, XHR, forms, and cookies; in order to
identify risks and architectural flaws.

### Current focus

Lately, little progress has been made, as I have been focusing on using this for
an application; to help discover issues; and help prioritise.

But I want to see this support [Datastar](https://data-star.dev/), another
hypermedia framework. This brings some larger changes that have been underway
for some time; but this also requires significant additions to v8go:

- ESM support
- ECMAScript object property handlers
- [MutationObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver)
  support.

In addition, some existing features are incorrectly implemented, such as live
collections.

A side project worked on in parallel is to support Goja as an alternate script
engine; though it has had little attention for some time.

#### ESM support

Datastar is distrubuted ECMAScript modules, not scripts. So for Gost-DOM to
support Datastar, ESM support is needed.

However, v8go, which is the link to V8 doesn't expose Module compilation and
execution. I am working on extending v8go to support ESM. This isn't trivial.

#### ECMAScript object property handlers

"Handlers" is a feature in V8, where access to properties on an object can be
intercepted by native code. Gost-DOM uses a modified version of v8go that has
where support for indexed getters was hastily added to progresss and explore the
problem space.

But full hander support will be needed for e.g.,
[`HTMLElement.dataset`][dataset] support.

#### MutationObserver

DataStar uses the [MutationObserver] API

Currently, a Go version exists as an `internal` module. The API is not yet
exposed to JavaScript.

The mutation observer API is also intended to serve as support for test code
describing behaviour at a higher and more accessibility-friendly manner.

E.g., rather than checking that a `role="Alert"` was not present _before_
form submit, but present after, you could verify that submitting an invalid form
causes an _announcement_ to be made.

#### Fix already implemented features

Many of the already implemented features or APIs are not completely implemented,
a few examples.

- Assigning to the `history` doesn't navigate
- [Live collections](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCollection) are static.
- Submit buttons cannot override form method and action.

To give users a better chance of predicting what works, and what doesn't, it is
an aim to make sure that existing features work as they would in a real browser.

#### Goja support

V8 depends on Cgo, but [Goja](https://github.com/dop251/goja) is a pure Go
JavaScript engine. While it may not be as complete as V8, it could be a usable
alternative for many projects providing a pure Go option.

V8 support will not go away, so there's always a fallback, if important JS
features are lacking from Goja.

### Memory Leaks

The current implementation is leaking memory for the scope of a browsing
context. all DOM nodes created and deleted for the lifetime of the context will
stay in memory until navigating, or the browser is actively disposed.

**This is not a problem for the intended use case**. Web scraping SPAs _might_
become a problem.

Actions that will reset the browsing context are:

- Clicking a link (default behaviour not prevented by JavaScript)
- Submitting a form (default behaviour not prevented by JavaScript)
- Refresh or navigating history entries generated by these operations.

Examples that **will not reset** the browsing context are (not necessarily a
complete list):

- Navigating an SPA.
- Navigating an HTML app with boosted links.
- Navigating history entries generated by these types of actions.

#### Why memory leaks

This codebase is a marriage between two garbage collected runtimes, and what is
conceptually _one object_ is split into two, a Go object and a JavaScript
wrapper. As long of them is reachable; so must the other be.

I could join them into one; but that would result in an undesired coupling; the
DOM implementation being coupled to the JavaScript execution engine.

Since this project started, weak references has been introduced to Go 1.24 which
I beleve provides a solution to the problem, but this hasn't been prioritised 

For that reason; and because it's not a problem for the intended use case, I
have postponed dealing with that issue.


### Future goals

There is much to do, which includes (but this is not a full list):

- Support web-sockets and server events.
- Implement all standard JavaScript classes that a browser should support; but
  not part of the ECMAScript standard itself.
  - JavaScript polyfills would be a good starting point; which is how xpath is
    implemented at the moment.
    - Conversion to native go implementations would be prioritized on usage, e.g.
      [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) 
      would be high in the list of priorities.
- Implement default browser behaviour for user interaction, e.g. pressing 
  <key>enter</key> when an input field has focus should submit the form.

### Long Term Goals

#### CSS Parsing

Parsing CSS woule be nice, allowing test code to verify the resulting styles of
an element; but having a working DOM with a JavaScript engine is higher
priority.

#### Mock external sites

The system may depend on external sites in the browser, most notably identity
providers (IDP), where your app redirects to the IDP, which redirects on
successful login; but could be other services such as map providers, etc.

For testing purposes, replacing this with a dummy replacement would have some
benefits:

- The verification of your system doesn't depend on the availability of an
  external service; when working offline
- Avoid tests breaking due to a new UI in your external dependency.
- For an identity provider
  - Avoid pollution of dummy accounts to run your test suite.
  - Avoid locking out test accounts due to _"suspiscious activity"_.
  - The IDP may use a Captcha or 2FA that can be impossible; or difficult to
    control from tests, and would cause a significant slowdown to the test
    suite.
- For applications like map providers
  - Avoid being billed for API use during testing.

## Out of scope.

### Full Spec Compliance

> A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something
> to aim at.
> 
> - Bruce Lee

While it is a goal to reach whatwg spec compliance, the primary goal is to have
a useful tool for testing modern web applications. 

Some specs don't really have any usage in modern web applications. For example,
you generally wouldn't write an application that depends on quirks mode.

Another example is `document.write`. I've yet to work on any application that
depends on this. However, implementing support for this feature require a
complete rewrite of the HTML parser. You would need a really good case (or
sponsorship level) to have that prioritised.

### Accessibility tree

It is not currently planned that this library should maintain the accessibility
tree; nor provide higher level testing capabilities like what
[Testing Library](https://testing-library.com) provides for JavaScript.

These problems _should_ eventually be solved, but could easily be implemented in
a different library with dependency to the DOM alone.

### Visual Rendering

It is not a goal to be able to provide a visual rendering of the DOM. 

But just like the accessibility tree, this could be implemented in a new library
depending only on the interface from here.

## Terminology

Some words inherntly have multiple meanings.

- **Interface**. The IDL Specification defines _interfaces_; which are exposed
in certain scopes, implemented by "classes" in JavaScript. 
  - The interfaces can be composed of _partial_ or _mixin_ interfaces.
  - IDL Interfaces and mixin interfaces are represented in Go, and typically exposed as Go `interface` types.
