// Package controller can simulate user interaction
//
// User interaction is primarily keyboard and mouse input. Mouse input is
// primarily clicking elements. Keyboard input should also handle:
//
// - Move focus when pressing `tab`
// - Submit a form when pressing `enter` in a form field
//
// Assuming that the events are not cancelled, and forms pass validation.
