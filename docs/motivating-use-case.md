## Motivating use case

The motivating use case for Gost-DOM are hypermedia-applications, where the
application behaviour is the choreography of attributes on HTML elements,
hypermedia frameworks like HTMX or Datastar, and server end-points written to
handle hypermedia requests.

Tests of the individual parts would be tightly coupled to implementation
details. The behaviour of the application can only be verified in a browser-like
environment.
