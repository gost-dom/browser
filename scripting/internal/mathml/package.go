// Package mathml implements (part of) the MathML-Core web API
//
// Generally, package names represent web API names, which are reflected by file
// names in the webref sources. MathML deviates from the standard.
//
// - MDN doesn't have a specific "MathML" API entry, only element documentation
// - webref has a "mathml-core" spec, and the hyphen is not a good package name
//
// Thus, the go package was named "mathml"
package mathml
